# Dedicated space for Geospatial related scripts

## YMCA 03/21/2019

*The script [spatialYMCA.R](https://github.com/AdrienneGast/R-scripts/blob/master/GIS/spatialYMCA.R) is a first step that tries to combine the most common GIS computations used for data building in ecological studies. It is a work in progress script and we will add some other part in the future (such as a part on ggplot2 spatial maps).*
It has been constructed thanks to a lot of resources such as:
* [Olivier Gimenez GitHub page](https://github.com/oliviergimenez/) for the sf package example
* [some stackoverflow answers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47116217/overlay-raster-layer-on-map-in-ggplot2-in-r)
* and for the landscape metrics example [this resource](http://j.p.rossi.free.fr/rpackages/ecpaysage/TD_Analyse_quanti_paysage.html#(1))
* and of course thanks to all the persons involved.
